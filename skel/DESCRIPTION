Title: Inference in Meta Analysis and Meta Regression
Description: Provides methods for making inference in the random effects meta regression model such as point estimates and confidence intervals for the heterogeneity parameter and the regression coefficients vector.  Inference methods are based on different theoretical schools to statistical inference.  Methods from three different philosophies are included: methods based on the method of moments approach, methods based on likelihood, and methods based on generalised inference.  The package also includes tools to run extensive simulation studies in parallel on high performance clusters in a modular way.  This allows extensive testing of custom inferential methods with all implemented state-of-the-art methods in a standardised way.  Tools for evaluating the performance of both point and interval estimates are provided.  Also, a large collection of different pre-defined plotting functions is implemented in a ready-to-use fashion.
