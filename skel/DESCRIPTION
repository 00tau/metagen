Title: Inference in the Random Effects Meta Regression Model
Description: Provides methods for making inference in the random effects meta regression model, such as point estimates and confidence intervals for the heterogeneity parameter and the regression coefficients vector.  Inference method are based on different statistical approaches.  Also includes tools to run extensive simulation studies in parallel on high performance clusters.  This allows for extensive testing of current inference methods with new and state-of-the-art methods.  Functions for evaluating the performance of both point and interval estimates are provided.  Also, a large collection of different pre-defined plotting functions is implemented in a ready-to-use fashion.
