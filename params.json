{"name":"Metagen","tagline":"R package for meta analysis and meta regression","body":"The R-package metagen\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis is an R-package for inference in the random effects meta regression model.\r\nThe purpose of the package is two fold. On the one hand, it allows the user to\r\nrun different inferential methods on any given data that follow a meta analysis\r\nor meta regression model. The output is a neat summary of all kinds of\r\ndifferent methods, many of which are commonly used in the meta analysis or meta\r\nregression context and some which are not as common, too. The big feature are\r\ntwo methods based on generalised inference principles.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the package allows to run rather sophisticated large scale\r\ncomputer experiments that evaluate the performance of all implemented methods\r\nwith respect to coverage probability (and, well, average length). The idea is\r\nto use the above procedures to trace out the possible magnitude of the unknown\r\nparameters of the model, and, then, to use the possibility of running computer\r\nexperiments in a possible sub-space of the parameter space to get an idea of\r\nwhich method yield, in fact, trustworthy results.\r\n\r\nInstallation from CRAN\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install the package in a running R environment is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages(\"metagen\")\r\nlibrary(\"metagen\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstallation using devtools GitHub-functionality\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you have `devtools` installed on your system, you can install the latest\r\nup-to-date version of `metagen` directly from within R.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstall.package(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"metagen\")\r\nlibrary(\"metagen\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstallation manually from GitHub\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter cloning the repository, you may use the following magic in the build\r\ndirectory to build and install the package on your system:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake package\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen open up an R-session and type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(\"metagen\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you are good to go.\r\n\r\nWhere to start\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nStart to get a feel for the functionality of the package by having a\r\nlook at the help files of the functions `metareg` and `metagen`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n?metareg\r\n?metagen\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should get you started very quickly.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
