{"name":"Metagen","tagline":"R package for meta analysis and meta regression","body":"The R-package metagen\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis is an R-package for inference in the random effects meta regression\r\nmodel.  The purpose of the package is two fold.  On the one hand, it\r\nallows the user to run different inferential methods on any given data\r\nthat follow a meta analysis or meta regression model.  The output is a\r\nneat summary of all kinds of different methods, many of which are commonly used in the meta analysis or meta regression context and some which are not as common, too. The big feature are two methods\r\nbased on generalised inference principles.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the package allows to run rather sophisticated large\r\nscale computer experiments that evaluate the performance of all\r\nimplemented methods with respect to coverage probability (and, well,\r\naverage length).  The idea is to use the above procedures to trace out\r\nthe possible magnitude of the unknown parameters of the model, and, then, to use the\r\npossibility of running computer experiments in a possible sub-space of the\r\nparameter space to get an idea of which method yield, in fact, trustworthy results.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou may use the following magic to build and install the package on your\r\nsystem:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake package\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen open up an R-session and type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(metagen)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you are good to go.\r\n\r\nWhere to start\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nStart to get a feel for the functionality of the package by having a\r\nlook at the help files of the functions `metareg` and `metagen`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n?metareg\r\n?metagen\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should get you started very quickly.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
